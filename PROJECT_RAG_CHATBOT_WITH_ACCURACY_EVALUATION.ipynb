The chatbot uses FAISS for similarity search and a Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation. Additionally, it evaluates the accuracy of its answers using ROUGE-1 F1 Score, comparing generated responses with expected answers from the PDF.**\n",

The chatbot utilized FAISS for similarity search and an LLM (DeepSeek/LLaMA-2-7B) for response generation, ensuring responses were contextually relevant.**\n",

The results demonstrated that the chatbot effectively retrieved relevant information and generated structured answers. However, accuracy varied depending on PDF content quality, retrieval precision, and LLM output coherence.**"
